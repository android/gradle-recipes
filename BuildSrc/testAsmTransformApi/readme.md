# Transforming classes with ASM

This sample shows how to transform classes with ASM class visitors. The example transformer prints a bytecode trace
generated by TraceClassVisitor to the standard output for all classes in the package `com.example`.

This API is experimental and is subject to breaking changes.

## To Run
./gradlew transformDebugClassesWithAsm
